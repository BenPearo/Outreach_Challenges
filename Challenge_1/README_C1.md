# Challenge 1: Area and Circumference of a Circle

For this challenge, you aer given part of a working program. By modifying
only the functions, can you get it working?

Pt 2. Can you place the function in a loop so the user can calculate radius until they
enter a `q`

## Hints

Circumference of a circle = 2 x Pi x radius

Area of a circle = Pi x radius squared

## Sample input/output

```
Enter the radius of the circle: 5

Area of the circle is: 78.54
Circumference of the circle: 31.42
```
